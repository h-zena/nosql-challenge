### The Setup Starter is in notebook NoSQL_setup_starterDA

### Referenced official documentation from PyMongo library at https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html and MongoDB documentation at https://www.mongodb.com/docs/. Utilized AI Learning Assistant to assist troubleshooting any errors. For the 'Update the new restaurant with the BusinessTypeID you found' and 'The magazine is not interested in any establishments in Dover' portions of the project, I want to clarify that I accidentally re-ran the code, which resulted in the count showing as zero. However, I had initially executed the code correctly, and the intended updates and deletions were successfully performed.
### Worked closley with Dara Adesina to complete the assignment.
